mltrace documentation
===================================

``mltrace`` is an open-source Python tool to track data flow through various
components in ML pipelines. It offers the following:

- coarse-grained lineage and tracing
- Python API to log versions of data and pipeline components
- database to store information about component runs
- UI to show the trace of steps in a pipeline taken to produce an output

``mltrace`` is designed specifically for Agile or multidisciplinary teams collaborating on machine learning or complex data pipelines.

Design principles
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- Simplicity (users should know *exactly* what the tool does)
- Rinse and repeat other successful designs
    - Decorator design similar to Dagster solids_
    - Logging design similar to MLFlow tracking_
- API designed for both engineers and data scientists
- UI designed for people to help triage issues *even if they didnâ€™t build the ETL or models themselves*

Roadmap
^^^^^^^

We are actively working on the following:

- Displaying whether components are "stale" (i.e. you need to rerun a component such as training)
- REST API to log from any type of file, not just a Python file
- Prometheus integrations to monitor component output distributions
