# Example Application

To test out and iterate and develop `mltrace`, we will have an example of an end-to-end pipeline that does some basic ML. It is hard to develop devtools in a vacuum :)

I really don't care about ML applications right now, so I will just pull something from thin air. Ideally, it is a toy but has enterprise-grade infrastructure (aws, Airflow, scheduled jobs, etc).
